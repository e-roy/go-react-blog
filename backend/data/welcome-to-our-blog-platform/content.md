## Getting Started

Check out the [deployment guide](/blogs/deploying-go-react-to-railway) to get started.

## Developer Note

This project also serves as a **personal learning journey** for the developer. As someone exploring Go for the first time, this blog platform provides hands-on experience with:

- **Go backend development** - Learning Go's syntax, patterns, and best practices
- **File-based storage** - Understanding how to build data persistence without databases
- **API design** - Creating RESTful endpoints and handling HTTP requests
- **Type generation** - Building tools to maintain frontend-backend type consistency
- **Deployment** - Learning Railway deployment and production considerations

The blog content will document this learning process, sharing insights, challenges, and discoveries along the way. This makes the project both a practical tool and a learning resource for other developers interested in Go.
